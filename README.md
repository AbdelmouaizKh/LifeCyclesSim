# Evolution Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates the evolution of populations of creatures and their interaction with the environment. It models creatures (animals and trees) with DNA-based traits and explores dynamics such as reproduction, mutations, and survival.

## Features
- DNA-based attributes for animals and trees.
- Reproduction with mutation to simulate evolution.
- Interaction between creatures and their environment (trees providing food).
- Expandable framework for adding more features like toxicity, predator-prey dynamics, and natural selection.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries
